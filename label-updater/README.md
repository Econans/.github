# label-updater

This tool will copy/update all label templates from this repository to all other repositories within the organization.

The tool requires a PAT with the right permissions, and will first do a dry run and output what changes would be made, after which you're prompted to either confirm the changes and do a live run, or cancel the process.

Instructions:
 
`npm install`  
`node label`

Follow the instructions in the terminal.

#### Please be aware that because this repository needs to be public, no sensitive information should ever be present here.
